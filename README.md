# MariaDB-spatial-UDF

This code is original work of Albert Rovira (github user: krandalf75) 


The code was last updated 8 years ago and was only considering MySQL as a database server due to the fact that the ORACLE did not buy MySQL at the time and MariaDB did not existed yet. Therefore I have taken the liberty of hard-forking the code to make a clean start. 

Albert Rovira has published this code under GPL so I follow the same license for the code and all rights are still belong to him. 

## How to use the code
